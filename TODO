TODO
----

Short term:
  - Consolidate QCLib code and separate circuit datastructure into circuitkit.
  - Symbolic representation of elements in Z[1/sqrt(2), i]. Potentially reuse Vadym's code for sqct.
  - UI-triggered MATLAB output of whole-circuit unitary and unitary for selection.
  - UI-triggered color-coded rendering of circuit and selection unitary.
  - Finish update of documentation, replacing figures and screen captures.
  - Set up and begin maintaining regular builds for Mac OS X.
  - More stringent checks in cmake file.
  - Finish updating user guide.

Medium term:
  - Implement grouping of like-named wires into 'buses' as per discussion with Andrei Lapets.
  - Fix remaining rendering bugs in various edge cases.
  - Implement visual drag-and-drop: Show gate placement as gate is being dragged over circuit.
  - Implement dragging of existing gates from point to point in circuit.
  - Review all code, attempt to clean up crashes.
  - Finish inline code documentation.

Long term:
  - Implement abstract drawing features as per discussion with Martin.
  - Design/implement measurement and classical feedback features.

New fix suggestions:
  - Not needing to hold down the mouse & drag for adding gates would be nice
  - Moving existing gates in a diagram
  - Save should be under File, and not Circuit
  - Save dialog should open to the directory of the previous save command
  - Save and Save As... should be distinct commands
  - When you save a .qc file, .eps, .png, .svg, etc you should auto-append the file extension
    (to prevent accidentally overwriting your saved qc with a png)
  - Modal dialog should appear asking to confirm overwriting an existing file during save
  - Hotkeys for adding gates to a diagram would be sweet
